"""
What the GenAI commands put on the wire, and what they make of what comes back.

The engine is a third party: we do not get to choose its paths, its field
names or its shapes, and every one of them is asymmetric somewhere. `name`
goes in and `scorer_name` comes back. A delete takes `request_ids` while its
own error message asks for `trace_ids`. Durations arrive formatted for a human
and ids arrive base64. A disagreement about any of it reads as "no traces"
rather than as a bug, which is why these are pinned here rather than left to
be noticed in a console.

The bodies below are verbatim from a running engine, trimmed.
