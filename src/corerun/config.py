"""
Configuration management for corerun SDK.

Supports configuration via:
1. Direct initialization: corerun.init(auth_token="...", workspace="...")
2. Environment variables: CORERUN_AUTH_TOKEN, CORERUN_WORKSPACE, CORERUN_API_URL
3. Config file: ~/.corerun/config
4. Platform credential: /etc/corerun/api-key, installed in corerun notebooks

The platform credential is last so that anything the user chose themselves —
`corerun login`, an explicit key — wins over the one the notebook was handed.
