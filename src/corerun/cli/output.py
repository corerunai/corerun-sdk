"""
How commands print.

A CLI gets used two ways: read by a person, and piped into something else. The
same command has to serve both, so every command renders through here rather
than printing directly, and a single global flag decides which form comes out.

JSON mode also has to be *only* JSON. A progress spinner, a heading, or a
"[green]done[/green]" on stdout makes the output unparseable, so in JSON mode
everything that is not the payload goes to stderr, where a person can still see
it and a pipe ignores it.
