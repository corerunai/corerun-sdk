"""
Bare-metal host CLI commands.

A host is a cluster to everything downstream -- it registers under a cluster
name and speaks the same operator protocol -- but it is not onboarded like one.
There is no Kubernetes to apply a manifest to, so it is set up by running two
commands on the machine itself. That difference is the whole of why this is its
own group rather than a flag on `clusters add`.
