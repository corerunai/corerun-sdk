corerun clusters.

The clusters a workspace can schedule onto, including live resource data
reported by each connector -- and what it takes to add one.

A cluster is not created with a kubeconfig. It is *prepared*: a record is made
with an connector credential, and the platform hands back something to apply on the
target. Applying it makes the connector phone home and the cluster registers itself,
which is why nothing here takes a cluster's address or its credentials.
